# FEATURES #


## Frequency ##

Cw for an event with respect to frequency is defined as follows (scaling might be needed): 

if [e < (frequency_mean + frequency_stdev) and e > (frequency_mean - frequency_stdev)]:
	Cw = log(e)
else:
	Cw = Inf.

Cd for an event with respect to frequency is defined as follows (scaling might be needed):

Cd = min[log(stdev(frequencies)), log(sequitur(floor(e / 60)))]


## Location ## 

Cw for an event with respect to location is defined as follows (scaling might be needed):

Cw = log(locations_frequencies[e][1-frequency])

Cd for an event with respect to location is defined as follows (scaling might be needed):

Cd = log(sequitur(locations))
