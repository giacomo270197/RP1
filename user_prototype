# FEATURES #

## Prototype belonging ##

Prototype[user] = e[user]

## Frequency ##

Cw for an event with respect to frequency is defined as follows (scaling might be needed): 

if [e[frequency] < (frequency_mean + frequency_stdev) and e[frequency] > (frequency_mean - frequency_stdev)]:
	Cw = log(e)
else:
	Cw = Inf.

Cd for an event with respect to frequency is defined as follows (scaling might be needed):

Cd = min[log(abs(e[frequency] - frequency_mean)), log(sequitur(frequencies, round(e[frequency] / 60)))]


## Location ## 

Cw for an event with respect to frequency and location is defined as follows (scaling might be needed):

if e[location] in locations:
	Cw = log(1 - locations_info[e[location]][location_frequency])
else:
	Cw = Inf.

Cd for an event with respect to location is defined as follows (scaling might be needed):

Cd = log(sequitur(locations, e[location]))


## Computer ##

Cw for an event with respect to frequency and computer is defined as follows (scaling might be needed):

if e[computer] in computers:
	Cw = log(1 - computers_info[e[computer]][computer_proportion])
else:
	Cw = Inf.

Cd for an event with respect to computer is defined as follows (scaling might be needed):

Cd = log(sequitur(computers, e[computer]))
